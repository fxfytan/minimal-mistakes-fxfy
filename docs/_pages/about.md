Fayth Tan (they/them) is an independent science writer and researcher based in Pasadena, CA.

They write about the stories we tell ourselves about science— how we construct them, who gets to tell them, how our fears, anxieties, hopes and passions inexorably bleed into it. They’ve been recognized by the National Academy of Sciences for two essays, winning the Schmidt Award for Excellence in Science Communication in 2022. The rest of their writing can be found here.

They were a developmental biologist at Caltech, and graduated with a Ph.D. in Biology in June 2023. Their thesis research was in animal regeneration from an evolutionary-developmental perspective, studying how animals make and re-make themselves.
